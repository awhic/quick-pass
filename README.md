# QuikPass
QuikPass is a safe and reliable password generator. 
This project serves two purposes:
- To solve a real problem: sometimes, built-in password managers in web browsers will not detect when a user's cursor is in a new password field, and will not prompt the user to accept or deny a randomly-generated password to store in the password manager.
- To demonstrate core competency with respect to single-line java applications.
